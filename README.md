# unisharecar-wp
 Template website for a fictional car rental service available at Curtin University. Written with PHP, MySQL and WordPress.
 
 .c9 files included as the site has been hosted and tested via the Cloud9 development environment
 
 Known issues:
 - Bug in the 'Car Locator' Economy filter option. I have attempted to resolve this but am unable to see the cause. This filter is set up      in the same way the other filter options are, and the other filter options work as expected.
 - Calendar plugin used for the 'Date of Birth' field in the form on the 'Register' page produces unusual dates. May remove and replace        if I cannot fix it.
